## Code commenting best practices

- **Self-Documenting**: Clear structure and naming
- **Minimal Comments**: Concise, explain large sections only
- **Explain "Why"**: Capture intent, rationale, trade-offs; avoid restating obvious
- **No Temporary Comments**: Avoid comments about recent changes or fixes; keep evergreen
- **TSDoc for Public APIs**: Document all public API functions with TSDoc comments (with a simple example usage)
