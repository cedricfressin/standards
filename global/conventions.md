## General development conventions

- **Project Structure**: Predictable, logical organization
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date README with setup, architecture, contribution guidelines
- **Dependencies**: Keep up-to-date and minimal; document major ones
- **Version Control**: Clear commit messages, feature branches, meaningful PR descriptions
- **Feature Flags**: Use for incomplete features over long-lived branches
- **Changelog**: Track significant changes and improvements
- **Environment**: Use env variables; never commit secrets or API keys
- **Code Review**: Consistent process with clear expectations
- **Testing**: Define required level before merging (unit, integration, e2e)
