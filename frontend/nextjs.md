## Next.js best practices

### Core Principles

- **Server-First Development**: Default to Server Components; use Client Components only when necessary for interactivity or browser APIs
- **Keep it Simple**: Implement solutions in the fewest lines with straightforward approaches
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode throughout; avoid the `any` type
- **Performance First**: Leverage React 19 and Turbopack without manual optimizations; use progressive rendering with Streaming and Suspense

### Routing

- **File-Based Routing**: Use the `app/` directory for routing; `page.tsx` defines pages, `layout.tsx` wraps child routes with shared UI, `loading.tsx` shows loading states, `global-error.tsx` handles global errors, `error.tsx` handles page errors
- **Params and SearchParams**: Always await `params` and `searchParams` in pages and layouts

### Server Actions

- **Use Server Actions for Secure Mutations**: Leverage Server Actions for form handling, API calls, authentication, and data mutations to prevent CSRF attacks, improve performance, and ensure secure server-side execution
- **'use server' Directive**: Mark functions with 'use server' directive to ensure exclusive server-side execution for secure mutations
- **Access Request Headers**: Read request headers in Server Components, API routes, and Server Actions using `headers()` from 'next/headers'
- **Access Cookies**: Read cookies in any Server Component; set cookies only in API routes or Server Actions using `cookies()` from 'next/headers'

### Client Components

- **Client Components**: Mark with `'use client'`; use for state, effects, and event listeners; minimize to reduce bundle size; check `typeof window !== 'undefined'` for browser APIs to avoid hydration errors

### Navigation Utilities

- **Navigation Utilities**: Use `redirect('/path')` from 'next/navigation' for redirects and `notFound()` for 404 errors in server components

### Optimization

- **Image and Font Optimization**: Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization and `next/font` for font loading
- **Progressive Loading**: Implement Suspense boundaries and Partial Prerendering (PPR) to combine static and dynamic content

### Security

- **Server-Side Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server to prevent security vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management**: Never expose sensitive data in client code; manage API keys and secrets using environment variables on the server side
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Enforce HTTPS in production for all server communications to encrypt data in transit
- **Content Security Policy**: Configure CSP headers to define allowed content sources, reducing XSS, inline script execution, and data injection attack risks
